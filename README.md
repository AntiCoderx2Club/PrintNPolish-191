UPDATE: 11/9/21
    -After hours of trial and error, most of the code is working (woohoo). Here is what still needs to be done.
    -Routing login/register stuff to /users directory. (I.E. Homepage Navbar would have most the items the same, but instead of /login and /register it needs to be /users/login
and /users/register for EVERY page.
    -Routing the POST to the /users directory. Once that is done, I literally believe it will successfully be able to write to MongoDB and weâ€™ll be DONE (at least for this sprint).
    
    For further explanations, I will try to make a video and post it to our Google Drive
